# Cancer EHR Data Analysis â€“ UMAP, PCA, VAE, and Clustering

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks for analyzing cancer treatment data, patient timelines, and drug-specific effects.
The analyses employ **UMAP, PCA, VAE, clustering, and visualization techniques** to uncover hidden patterns in patient data, focusing on treatment outcomes, drug categories, and survival.

This script is for the EHR data used in the paper. To obtain the complete data, please contact the paper's authors.

## Key Features

* **Patient-level analysis**: Patient-level time-series analysis and state-space modeling.
* **Clustering**: K-means to construct clusters of patient states.
* **Dimensionality reduction/Visualization**: PCA, VAE, and linear projections and UMAP visualization.
* **Data Sources**: Patient IDs, treatment logs, laboratory/vital sign data.

* **Processing**:

  * Loads merged patient data.
  * Performs random sampling to balance patient groups.
  * Uses **stacked bar charts** to illustrate drug usage frequency and outcomes.

---

### 11. **VAE\_result.ipynb**

* **Purpose**: Visualization and analysis of latent variables obtained from a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** trained on cancer patient data.
* **Processing**:

  * Imports numerical, visualization, and deep learning libraries (`NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Torch`).
  * Loads VAE latent state outputs (`df_vae_dim16_zs_*`) from precomputed CSV files.
